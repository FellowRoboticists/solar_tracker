solar_tracker Arduino Sketch
==========================

This sketch is a part of a project that allows a sensor to follow the position of the sun
(or any bright light source).

The idea is to use a set of four LDR's to measure the differential light intensity to control
the position of the servos holding the sensors to equalize the light intensity to the four
sensors.

The effect is that of a pointer that is always directed at the brightest source of light in
the vicinity.
